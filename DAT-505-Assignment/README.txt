//How to use my audio visualization

Loading up index will take the user to a page where they select which audio visualization 
they want to view (the middle design is my most recent design 'index2.html' / index2.js).

From there they will be given the option to choose a quality in which 
they want to view the visualization. For lower end systems, choose the lower qualities.

The user is now able to select any song they want by clicking anywhere on 
the screen to select a file from their system. I have included some 
music to test within my project (located in folder -> music).

*******************************************************************************************
Songs 1 and 2 are the best for this visualization as I have stlyed this project around them.

If the visualization is not playing there is a ‘fall-back’ button you can click at 
the top middle of your screen. I have not had to use this yet, but I chose to implemented it just in case. 
(This will disappear after 5 seconds if it’s not clicked. This is to remove elements off screen 
that may impact the viewing experience).

In the top left of the page you can hover your mouse to fade in the audio controls for the selected file. 
From there the user can move through the song, play, pause and adjust the volume.

Once the user has selected a song they are able to adjust how the 
visualization looks by altering the Postprocessing affect via the DAT-GUI. 
Furthermore the user can also move around the scene by clicking and moving their mouse anywhere on screen.
